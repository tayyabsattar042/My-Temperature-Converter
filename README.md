# My-Temperature-Converter
This is Temperature Converter made by Me . I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I have also used latest tailwind css in making this Temperature Converter.
In this code , I have created a user-friendly web page for converting temperatures between different scales using JavaScript logic and applies styling using the Tailwind CSS framework. Users can input a temperature, select the scales, and click the "Convert" button to see the converted temperature.
